Hear are examples of simple formating in Markdown.
Note that nothing except the YAML header section (section \@ref(yaml-header)) is specific to R Markdown.

# Headings

We can create a heading with `#`, so for a level one heading we use:

- `# Heading level 1`
- `## Heading level 2`
- `### Heading level 3`

and so on.
If we have numbered sections turned on (as we do in on this page), these headings will be automatically numbered.

## Level 2 heading example

Like so

# Simple text formating

As demonstrated in the [prior page](../../../../2022/05/10/rational-and-markdown-basics), we can wrap text with `*` to get bold and italic text:

- **bold text** = `**bold text**`
- *italic text* = `*italic text*`
- ***bold and italic text*** = `***bold and italic text***`
- <u>Underlined text</u> = `<u>Underlined text</u>`
- ~~Deleted text~~ = `~~Deleted text~~`
- `code` = `` `code` ``
- > blockquote = `> blockquote`
- ==highlight== = `==highlight==`
-  H~2~O = `H~2~O`
- X^2^ = `X^2^`

Note that there are other ways of dealing with super and subscripts, please see the Equations section (section \@ref(math)) for that.

For a horizontal rule use `---`:

---

For footnotes we can use `[^1]` by the text, and then define the footnote on a separate line with `[^1]:`

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

To start a new paragraph you need to leave a blank line.

This is a second paragraph.
I'd recommend putting each sentence on separate lines as I find it easier to read when looking at the source file, and it comes in handy if you use version control, but this isn't strictly needed.

## Lists

To start an unordered list we can use a `-`.
Note that there should be a blank line before and after the dash.
For the sublist we simply indent the `-`

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
  - subitem 1
  - subitem 2
  - subitem 3

For an ordered list we can use a number followed by a period: `1.`.
Note that the actual number doesn't really matter as when the document is compiled it'll render the list correctly.
If you check the source file for this page you'll see that I just used `1.` repeatedly, and yet it renders as you'd want it to.

1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3
  - subitem 1
  - subitem 2
  - subitem 3

## Links and images

To insert a link we wrap the text we want to appear in `[]` and follow with the address in `()`:

- [Example link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) = `[Example link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)`

We can include an image in the same way, but with an `!` at the begining:

- ![Example image](example_image.jpg) = `![Example image](example_image.jpg)`

Note that I wouldn't recommend inserting images like this when working with R Markdown, as there are alternatives that are easier to control.
Please see [this page](../../../../2022/05/11/03-including-code/) for more details on this.

# Equations {#math}

Inline LaTeX equations can be made by wrapping them with `$`:

- Here is some inline maths $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$ = `$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$`

Or for a equation block we can use double `$$`:

$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

which looks like this: `$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$`

## Greek letters
