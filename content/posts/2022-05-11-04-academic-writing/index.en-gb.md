There are few additional aspects we have to think about for academic writing, this page covers the most important aspects of this.

Firstly, if you aren't already using a [reference manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software), then you really should be!
Regardless of what you use for writing, a reference manager is a very useful way of building a collection of the papers you've read (or plan to read...), and allows you to easily insert citations into your writing.
There are lots of software available, but I'd recommend [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as it's free and open-source (as all good software should be!) and it has a neat [browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/) which makes adding references to Zotero relatively painless.
