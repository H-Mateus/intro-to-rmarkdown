R Markdown is an extension of basic Markdown which aims to provide an authoring framework for science.

There are three basic components of an R Markdown document: the metadata, text and code.
The metadata comes at the start of the document and is written between a pair of three dashes: `---`.
The syntax for the metadata is [YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language, formerly Yet Another Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and is also called the YAML metadata or the YAML frontmatter.

***Importantly***, YAML is indentation sensitive!
This means if the indentation is not right, you'll get an error when you try to compile the document.
For this reason, I'd generally suggest copying YAML elements you want from one document to another, or using templates/snippets, especially when you're just getting started.
See section \@ref(yaml-header) for some examples of YAML headers 

Following the metadata is the body of the document.
The syntax for the body is Markdown (see [this page](../../../../2022/05/11/02-basic-formatting/) for details on that).

For the code, there are two types which can be included:

- A code chunk, which start with three backticks like `` ```{r} ``, where `r` sets the languaged used (despite the "R Markdown" name, R is not the only language we can use!), and ends with three backticks `` ``` ``
- An inline code expression starts with a single backtick like `` `r ``, and ends with another backtick `` ` ``

See section \@ref(code-chunks) for more details on including code

# The YAML header {#yaml-header}

Below is an example of a minimal YAML header:

```
---
title: "Hello R Markdown"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2018-02-14"
output: html_document
---

And our document body starts here
```

In the above example we have 4 key-value pairs, where the keys are specific elements of the metadata, and the values are what they should be set to.
Now here's another example:

```
---
title: "Hello R Markdown"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2018-02-14"
output:
  html_document:
    # Here we enable a table of contents in the html output
    toc: true
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
---
```

**Notice the indentation!!!**

It's not just for show.
The document won't compile if the indentation isn't right, so be mindful of that when playing with the YAML.
Also notice that we can have comments in the YAML too, this can be great for reminding yourself what an option does when getting started.

I'd suggest playing around with the templates to explore further options, but here is one of my prefered starting YAMLs:
